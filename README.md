THIS IS NOT SAFE.

Be very careful about using this, as there are no safeties attached. Right now it only reads
.jpg images. 

Source directory is hardcoded, but can easily be changed to ask the user which source
directory to use. 

This will rename and move any .jpg files in the source directory to a destination directory.
